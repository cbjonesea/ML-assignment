# ML-assignment
 This is the final assignment for my Machine Learning class (Block 4 2025, Tilburg University) as part of my M.Sc. in Data Science.

 In this challenge, the task is to predict the revenue of rental properties, based on various features of these properties. 

 The baseline.zip file contains code for the baseline model. My goal is to beat the performance of this baseline model with my own design.

 The model_building.ipynb file contains a Jupyter notebook where I've tried out different models as well as explained the pre-processing, feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning steps I've taken to build them.

The "CJones_Submission.." .py files contain the final models that I submitted to the competition for each of my 4 submissions.
